# Restaurant POS System

## Introduction

In the summer of 2024, I embarked on a journey to learn Python and set a goal to recreate the POS (Point of Sale) system from the restaurant where I previously worked. After three months of being self-taught in Python, I successfully completed this project. The functionality of the system closely mirrors the original POS system, surpassing my initial expectations.

## Key Features

- User-friendly interface for order entry
- Real-time order total calculation
- Customizable menu options with categories
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Efficient data handling with lists and dictionaries

## Future Enhancements

I plan to continue developing this program by adding the following features:

- Ability to apply discounts
- Ability to manage multiple orders simultaneously
- Enhanced payment screen interface with multiple payment options
